Kidney Disease. \n","Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a type of kidney disease in which a gradual loss of kidney function occurs over a period of months to years. \n","Chronic kidney disease also affects the kidneys by damaging them and hence are not able to filter waste and excess fluids from the body as effectively as they should. \n","CKD is a progressive and hereditary disease.\n","High blood pressure, diabetes, and certain infections are causes of CKD.\n","In 2015, it caused 1.2 million deaths, up from 409,000 in 1990. \n","Chronic kidney disease affected 753 million people globally in 2016. \n","The causes that contribute to the greatest number of deaths are high blood pressure at 550,000, followed by diabetes at 418,000, and glomerulonephritis at 238,000. \n","High blood pressure is one of the causes of CKD. \n","Diabetes is one of the causes of CKD. \n","Glomerulonephritis is one of the causes of CKD. \n","About one of five adults with hypertension and one of three adults with diabetes have CKD. \n","CKD increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, and people with CKD often have other risk factors for heart disease, such as high blood lipids. \n","Chronic kidney disease results in worse all-cause mortality (the overall death rate) which increases as kidney function decreases. \n","The leading cause of death in chronic kidney disease is cardiovascular disease, regardless of whether there is progression to stage 5. \n","However, it is associated with an increased short-term mortality due to complications of the surgery. \n","There is currently no cure for CKD. \n","Initially generally no symptoms are seen. \n","Later on symptoms of CKD can be swelling in the ankles and feet, fatigue, changes in urine output, anemia, bone disease, high blood pressure, infections, nerve damage and poor nutrition. Worst cases include kidney failure.\n","In some cases, people with a family history of CKD have a higher chance of developing the disease themselves. \n","To prevent people that have a family history of CKD from developing CKD, they can maintain a healthy lifestyle, manage underlying health conditions, and get regular check-ups to monitor their kidney function.\n","CKD can be inherited. There are several genetic conditions that can cause CKD, such as polycystic kidney disease and Alport syndrome.

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a type of kidney disease in which a gradual loss of kidney function occurs over a period of months to years. Chronic kidney disease also affects the kidneys by damaging them and hence are not able to filter waste and excess fluids from the body as effectively as they should. CKD is a progressive and hereditary disease.High blood pressure, diabetes, and certain infections are causes of CKD.In 2015, it caused 1.2 million deaths, up from 409,000 in 1990. Chronic kidney disease affected 753 million people globally in 2016. The causes that contribute to the greatest number of deaths are high blood pressure at 550,000, followed by diabetes at 418,000, and glomerulonephritis at 238,000. High blood pressure is one of the causes of CKD. Diabetes is one of the causes of CKD. Glomerulonephritis is one of the causes of CKD. About one of five adults with hypertension and one of three adults with diabetes have CKD. CKD increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, and people with CKD often have other risk factors for heart disease, such as high blood lipids. Chronic kidney disease results in worse all-cause mortality (the overall death rate) which increases as kidney function decreases. The leading cause of death in chronic kidney disease is cardiovascular disease, regardless of whether there is progression to stage 5. However, it is associated with an increased short-term mortality due to complications of the surgery. There is currently no cure for CKD. Initially generally no symptoms are seen. Later on symptoms of CKD can be swelling in the ankles and feet, fatigue, changes in urine output, anemia, bone disease, high blood pressure, infections, nerve damage and poor nutrition. Worst cases include kidney failure.In some cases, people with a family history of CKD have a higher chance of developing the disease themselves. To prevent people that have a family history of CKD from developing CKD, they can maintain a healthy lifestyle, manage underlying health conditions, and get regular check-ups to monitor their kidney function.CKD can be inherited. There are several genetic conditions that can cause CKD, such as polycystic kidney disease and Alport syndrome. However, in many cases, CKD is not inherited and is caused by other factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and certain infections. The outlook for someone with CKD depends on the severity of the disease, the underlying cause, and the patient's overall health. Maintaining a healthy blood pressure and good blood sugar control through lifestyle changes such as eating healthily, getting regular exercise, and taking medications as prescribed can help prevent or slow the progression of CKD. It is possible to still have CKD after being diagnosed if no early treatment is performed.It is generally not possible to donate a kidney if you have CKD. Donors must be in good health with normal kidney function, and CKD is generally considered to be a disqualifying condition. Fatigue is one of the symptoms of CKD.Anemia is a symptom of CKD.Changes in urine output is a symptom of CKD.CKD affect the body with symptoms such as swelling in the ankles and feet, fatigue, changes in urine output, anemia, bone disease, high blood pressure, infections, nerve damage and poor nutrition. Worst cases include kidney failure.Complications associated with CKD can relate to hormonal dysfunction of the kidneys and include (in chronological order) high blood pressure, bone disease, and anemia. Additionally CKD patients have markedly increased cardiovascular complications with increased risks of death and hospitalization. Causes of chronic kidney disease include diabetes, high blood pressure, glomerulonephritis, and polycystic kidney disease. High blood pressure is a common cause of CKD. Diabetes is a common cause of CKD. Diabetes contribute to having CKD. High blood pressure contribute to having CKD.  CKD can be prevented or slowed by managing underlying conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure, and by maintaining a healthy lifestyle.The relationship between CKD and diabetes is that that the person has a higher chance of developing CKD if the person has diabetes. The relationship between CKD and high blood pressure is that the person has a higher chance of developing CKD if the person has high blood pressure. CKD can be reversed in the early stagesCKD is impossible to reverse in the late stages. CKD can be prevented or slowed by managing underlying conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure, and by maintaining a healthy lifestyle. CKD can be treated with medication. CKD is treated by managing the underlying cause of the disease and slowing the progression of the kidney damage in adults and children.  CKD is treated with the involvement of medications, lifestyle changes (such as eating healthily and getting regular exercise), and in advanced stages, with dialysis or a kidney transplant. To manage the underlying cause of the disease and slowing the progression of the kidney damage in adults and children, the treatment may involve medications, lifestyle changes (such as eating healthily and getting regular exercise), and in advanced stages, with dialysis or a kidney transplant. CKD be managed with diet and exercise most of the time alone in the early stages. People with CKD that have high blood pressure can be treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) (medications).People with CKD that have diabetes can be treated with insulin or oral diabetes medications.CKD can cause high cholesterol, which can increase the risk of heart disease. Statins or fibrates (medications) may be used to treat high cholesterol in people with CKD. CKD can cause skin problems. People with CKD can use emollients or antihistamines (medications) to treat skin problems. CKD can cause poor nutrition, which can lead to a range of complications such as anemia and muscle weakness.
